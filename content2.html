                        <p> 
                            The show "Westworld" presented by HBO shows one of possibilities of the future game.
                            The game designers of Westworld give the players superme power which allowed them to do anything they want without any consequence.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Therefore, the players will shoot or kill any AIs in the game for no reason. 
                            The AIs in Westworld are different than the NPC in the games because the game designers made the AIs look like a real human.
                            Another word, there are no different in look between human and AIs.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Is that should be future game end up?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The answer is No. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The video games is not only an entertainment, but also should pass on more valueable content to the world.
