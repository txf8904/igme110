                        <h3>Morality of Modern Game</h3>
                        <p> 
                            There are many modern games let players make moral decision while game playing.
                            However, most of the games have a shallow choice that cannot reflect the real world.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Moreover, the studies show that viedo game will impact on people's behaviors. 
                            Therefore, making a right content of video game is very important,
                            and that is duty for game designers. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Indeed, a lot of games try to aviod some of immoral behaviors in another way.
                            For example, in Grand Thft Auto, a violence related game, does not have any children characters.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            On the other hand, some games are using immoral or even illeal actions as their selling point.
                            Some of them have to be banned in many countries.
